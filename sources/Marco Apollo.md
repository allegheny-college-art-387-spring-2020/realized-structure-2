As a rite of passage in a far away land, a long long time ago, male children wishing to "become men" were forced to climb a very, very tall mountain in search of the dragon who had lived there for thousands of years. Instructed not to defeat the dragon, each participant in the rite took up the task of capturing the dragon in an artistic rendering, taking the drawing back to the kingdom to display for everyone to see as proof of their bravery. Each drawing is judged by how closely it resembles the previous drawings and, as such, there hasn't been much variety for hundreds of years.

Once completed, these young men are deemed "Right for the King," and are given trades to work, land, a small house, a cart, and a pack animal to pull it. It is said that these are the result of five wishes which the dragon promised to the kingdom many years ago.

To depart on their quest, children are given bread by the baker made from the wheat of all the farmers in the kingdom; paper from the stationery shop; from the blacksmith, a shield and sword; a telescope from the optician; special clothes for mountain wayfaring from the seamstress. They are also blessed by the witchdoctor with a charm to prevent them from waking the dragon.

Le Kid's birthday, on a Thursday, arrived, signalling that this was his time to scale the mountain and draw the dragon there. But, Le Kid was frightened. (Who could blame him!?) The town was excited for Le Kid's journey because he showed promise as an artist from a young age. Perhaps he could create the perfect copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy ... of the drawing they'd seen for so long. A perfect facsimile of a facsimile of a facsimile ... (You get the idea.)

Having been outfitted with all of the items given by the townsfolk, Le Kid set off on his journey. Rushing away with feigned enthusiasm, he hid at the base of the rocky slope making a tent from his extra clothes and began daydreaming and drawing. Eventually, however, he ran out of food and his charm had worn off (he could feel it). He had to make his way back to town. But, he made one last drawing (an impressionist one!) of the dragon so that he could say his duty had been dispatched.

Coming back to camp with his clothes torn up, and looking rather gaunt, the people of the town triumped in his return from what seemed to be a dangerous, but well-done task...until Le Kid showed them the drawing -- one unlike any that had ever been created.

The baker was so shocked, they couldn't bake for a week. The farmers could not farm! The witchdoctor fell silent. The blacksmith (named Smith), couldn't...SMITH! In short, everyone in the town was so disturbed by the drawing that they called a town meeting to decide what to do with Le Kid and his avant-garde art.

Driven by their duty, in despair the baker baked the strangest rolls anyone had ever seen; the witchdoctor began to create charms whose ingredient lists were altogether more pleasing (who uses eye of newt anymore, anyway). The seamstress showed up in clothes which blended colors and patterns never before seen! At first sight, everyone seemed out of joint -- the town was falling apart!

But slowly, all came to the same realization: Le Kid had inspired the village to new heights of making and creating. They embraced Le Kid and went about changing the rite so that everyone's individual expression was at the pratice's core. No one went to the mountain anymore.

And the dragon was lonely.
