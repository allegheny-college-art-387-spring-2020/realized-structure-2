Between the king's castle and a village to the east lies a dark thicket of trees that all are expressly forbidden to enter. Parents often tell horrible stories to their children about the consequences of going into the forest and, for many years, these stories saw to it that children stayed away. 

But, one cannot hold childish curiosity at bay for long.

One day, a group of children chost to enter the forest, climbing through its tangles and underbrush only to find that this forest was no more forboding, different, or dangerous than any other should be. Trees swayed gently in the wind and birdsong filled the air.

Somewhere near the center of the forest, the children came upon a stump holding a book written in a language they had never seen before. The idea of a new language gave the children a new sense of freedom and wonder, and they started using it to communicate with each other, returning to the stump to consult the book to learn more and more.

On a somewhat normal, perhaps better than average day, the King sallied forth from their castle to tour the kingdom. Seeing the children marching toward the forest, the King hailed them, riding up only to hear them speaking the forbidden language the children discovered in the forest. He knew that this language was the language of the people who had populated the countryside in the Beforetime, a time which the kingdom's historians had gone to great trouble to erase from the histories the children knew.

In a rage, the King scattered the children and their families across the kingdom. For many years, their network of spies made sure that none of these children ever spoke the language again.

And, of course, this is not the story parents tell to their children now, but is quite close to it. However, a new generation may one day outgrow or dare to brave the supposed wilds of the Dark Thicket.
