* Point value: 100 pts.
* Assigned: 12 February 2020
* CAD files due: 24 Feburary 2020, 1:30 PM
    * CAD file exchange occurs during class on 24 Februrary
* Full project due: 2 March 2020, 5:00 PM

## The Site

> ...there are passages [between place and space] such as the putting to death (or putting into a landscape) of heroes who transgress frontiers and, who guilty against a law of the place provide its restoration with their tombs; or again, on the contrary, the awakening of inert objects (a table, a forest, a person that plays a certain role in the environment...[s]tories thus carry out a labor that constantly transforms places into spaces or spaces into places.
>
> Michel de Certeau, "Spatial Stories," _The Practice of Everyday Life_

What features make a place a space (or vice-versa)? How are specific objects and landscapes essential to stories? Do the characters awaken place rather than place creating or awaking characters? This assignment intends to use de Certau's idea that place enables and tells stories itself, creating a stage ("theatre of action") without which there would be no story.

## Guidelines

### Sites

During site selection, you will choose one site from a set of labeled sites. When passing CAD files off, the site goes with them to the student receiving the files and your will inherit _their_ site.

### CAD file handoff

On the designated handoff day (24 February), you will exchange CAD files with another designer in the class.

### Material Budget

* Level 2

### Design

- [ ] A physical model occupying no less than 10 in<sup>2</sup> and no more than 15 in<sup>2</sup> which:
    * Takes advantage of a given piece of terrain to act as a "site" from which to tell the fairy tale you've chosen
    * Contains _no_ humans or humanoids
    * Uses features of landscape and objects representing figurative emotions/concepts/ideas from the story as visual forms
- [ ] A minimum of 2 CAD files (placed in the `installation` folder) which model:
    * A "plan view" of the site
    * "Elevation" views for all objects
- [ ] Sketches and other generative material placed in the `studies` folder

### Writing

- [ ] A foam-mounted label containing:
    * title of the structure (must be the title of the fairy tale chosen)
    * measurement of physical area taken up by the structure
    * materials used
    * your name

#### Nota bene

Keep in mind that all documentation (including, but not limited to the label) is potentially a part of the finished product. While not part of this project's evaluation, think of these materials as an opportunity to create an architectural design identity.

### Submitting the assignment

#### CAD designs

On the design deadline date (24 February), your CAD work should:

* Be at least 2 files
    * 1 "plan" view
    * 1 "elevation" view
* Provide measurements for both added and pre-existing landscape objects
* Include any landscape elements which make up part of the site

#### Final realized structure

* Materials must be turned in using the GitHub repository under which this project was assigned.
* Pictures of or representations of all references must be placed in the references directory of the repository
* All sketches should be placed in a `studies` directory
* All materials used to create/install should be placed in an `installation` directory (digital files used to produce objects (including 3D models, vector/raster files, et al.)
* The structure must be installed on the course terrain no later than 5:00 PM on the project due date

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness, taken to mean:
  * Building installed on the course terrain by the deadline
	* Accompanying materials turned in on GitHub by the deadline
- [ ] Insightful use of references and writing to inform the design/viewer
- [ ] Documentation of process
